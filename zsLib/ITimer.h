    //          that the clock is put to sleep and wakes up later only to
    //          discover that the timer never fired for many times when it
    //          should have. For example, a computer might be put to sleep
    //          and then the clock is wokeup only to find it is hours later
    //          and missed many events. To fire off hundreds of events at once
    //          is not desirable behaviour so a limit is put which is specified
    //          with "maxFiringTimerAtOnce" to prevent timer wakeup floods.
